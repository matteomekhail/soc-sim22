# Incident Response Playbook: USB Malware Propagation

## Severity: HIGH
## MITRE ATT&CK: T1091, T1204, T1547

---

## 1. Detection
- [ ] Endpoint protection alerts on executable from removable media
- [ ] USB device insertion logged by endpoint agent
- [ ] Suspicious process launched from USB drive letter
- [ ] Network anomaly: new C2 beaconing detected

## 2. Immediate Actions
- [ ] Disconnect affected endpoint from network (unplug ethernet)
- [ ] Do NOT remove the USB device (preserve evidence)
- [ ] Identify the specific USB device (vendor ID, serial number)
- [ ] Alert all employees: DO NOT plug in unknown USB devices

## 3. Containment
- [ ] Network quarantine for all affected hosts
- [ ] Block C2 domains/IPs at firewall
- [ ] Disable USB mass storage via Group Policy (temporary)
- [ ] Scan all endpoints for the malware signature

## 4. Eradication
- [ ] Remove malware from all infected systems
- [ ] Clean registry persistence mechanisms
- [ ] Delete malware copies from network shares
- [ ] Remove scheduled tasks created by malware
- [ ] Securely wipe the malicious USB device

## 5. Recovery
- [ ] Restore systems from clean backups if needed
- [ ] Re-enable USB access with monitoring
- [ ] Verify network shares are clean
- [ ] Monitor for re-infection indicators

## 6. Prevention
- USB device whitelisting (USBGuard)
- Disable autorun on all endpoints
- Employee security awareness training
- Network Access Control (NAC)
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) deployment
